## Some Glimpse and Screenshots of our website:-

.This is the main landing page of our website. Here clicking on any option on the Navbar will redirect the user to the respective Product Page.

## Roles & Responsibilities :-
.A crystal clear user-friendly product listing page. Which list all the products similar to the official website. I added the functionality for filtering out the product using ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù. Users can search and filter the products as per their needs. I also added another functionality for sorting out all the products on the page by price ‚ÄúHigh to low‚Äù & ‚ÄúLow to high‚Äù. Few mouseover functions and styling were also added for user attraction.
    
## Lessons Learned
From this construct week‚Äôs projects, we learned how effectively we can use the DOM to make our static page more responsive. Another thing is about Local Storage. Without the knowledge of local storage, we cant be able to do this much in this project.

I would like to thank Mr. Chandra Shekhar , the way he taught has helped me a lot and my concepts become crystal clear.
